# Variational Neural Networks Pytorch

This repository contains a Pytorch implementation of Variational Neural Networks (VNNs) and image classification experiments for [Variational Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/) paper.

In this paper, we propose a method for uncertainty estimation in neural networks called Variational Neural Network that, instead of considering a distribution over weights, generates parameters for the output distribution of a layer by transforming its inputs with learnable sub-layers.
In uncertainty quality estimation experiments, we show that VNNs achieve better uncertainty quality than Monte Carlo Dropout or Bayes By Backpropagation methods.
